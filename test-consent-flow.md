# Consent Form Upload Flow - Test Guide

## ✅ Updated Implementation Summary

The codebase has been successfully updated with enhanced consent form upload functionality:

### 🔧 **Journey Store Enhancements**
- Added `consentFormUploaded` and `treatmentStarted` boolean states
- Added corresponding setter functions: `setConsentFormUploaded`, `setTreatmentStarted`
- Added `resetJourney()` function for complete state reset

### 📱 **BookingDetails Page Updates**
- Enhanced state management with new consent form tracking
- Updated `handleDocumentUpload` to properly set consent form status
- Improved button label logic to reflect treatment progression
- Added detailed console logging for debugging

### 🎯 **Testing the Flow**

#### **Step 1: Reach Treatment Step (Step 2)**
1. Start the app and navigate to BookingDetails
2. Ensure journey is at step 2 with:
   - `odometerUploaded: true`
   - `destinationReached: true` 
   - `imageUploaded: true`
   - `currentStep: 2`

#### **Step 2: Trigger Consent Form Upload**
1. Slide the "Start Treatment" button
2. Upload modal opens with consent form configuration:
   - Title: "Upload consent form"
   - Subtitle: Instructions for consent form
   - Allows any file type (`*/*`)

#### **Step 3: Upload Process**
1. Select a document (PDF/image/any file type)
2. Watch upload progress animation (0-100%)
3. Document appears in upload list with success status

#### **Step 4: Final Upload Trigger**
1. Click the "Upload Form" button in the modal
2. `handleFinalUpload()` is called → `setShowSuccess(true)`

#### **Step 5: Success Modal Display** ✨
1. Success modal automatically appears with:
   - ✅ Checkmark icon (orange background)
   - "Upload Successfully!" title
   - "Your consent form has been received and treatment can begin." message
   - 2-second display duration + 400ms fade animation

#### **Step 6: Journey State Updates** 🎯
The following state changes occur automatically:
```javascript
// Before consent upload (Step 2)
{
  odometerUploaded: true,
  destinationReached: true,
  imageUploaded: true,
  consentFormUploaded: false,  // ← false
  treatmentStarted: false,     // ← false
  currentStep: 2               // ← "Start Shift"
}

// After consent upload (Step 3) 
{
  odometerUploaded: true,
  destinationReached: true,
  imageUploaded: true,
  consentFormUploaded: true,   // ✅ true
  treatmentStarted: true,      // ✅ true
  currentStep: 3               // ✅ "Process"
}
```

#### **Step 7: Visual Updates** 🎨
1. **VerticalJourneyStepper** shows:
   - ✅ Start Journey (completed)
   - ✅ Reach (completed)
   - ✅ Start Shift (completed)
   - 🔄 Process (current/active - purple highlight)
   - ⚪ End (pending)

2. **Slide Button** updates to:
   - "Treatment in Progress" (when at step 3)

#### **Step 8: Auto-Navigation**
1. Success modal fades out after 2 seconds
2. Automatically redirects to `/home/homePage`
3. Journey state persists via Zustand store

## 🐛 **Debug Logging**

Watch console for these messages:
- `"📝 Consent form uploaded - Treatment can begin!"`
- `"Upload processed for current journey state"`
- `"Document uploaded: [filename]"`

## 🎯 **Expected Success Indicators**

✅ **Success modal shows with consent-specific message**  
✅ **Journey progresses from Step 2 → Step 3**  
✅ **Visual stepper updates to show "Process" as active**  
✅ **Button label changes to "Treatment in Progress"**  
✅ **Auto-navigation back to home page**  
✅ **State persists across navigation**  

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

If the success modal doesn't appear:
1. Check console for upload completion logs
2. Verify `modalType` is set to `'consent'`
3. Ensure `handleFinalUpload()` is being called
4. Check `showSuccess` state in DocumentUploadModal

If state doesn't update:
1. Verify `handleDocumentUpload()` is called after file selection
2. Check journey state conditions in upload logic
3. Ensure Zustand store setters are functioning

## 🎉 **Implementation Complete!**

The consent form upload flow is now fully implemented with:
- ✅ Dynamic modal configuration
- ✅ Progress tracking with animations
- ✅ Success modal with custom messaging
- ✅ Automatic state progression
- ✅ Visual feedback via stepper component
- ✅ Auto-navigation and state persistence

**Ready for testing and deployment!** 🚀
